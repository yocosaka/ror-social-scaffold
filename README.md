## About the Project

This project is social media app called ‚ÄúStay in touch‚Äù.
Users can do the following actions:

As a guest user:

As a logged-in user:
- See all users list
- See selected user page with their user name and all posts written by them (the most recent posts on the top)
- Send a friendship invitation
- See a button ‚ÄúInvite to friendship‚Äù next to the name of user who is not my friend yet - on both users‚Äô list and single user page
- See pending friendship invitations sent to me from other users
- Accept or reject friendships invitation
- Create new posts (text only)
- Like/dislike posts (but I can like single post only once)
- Add comments to posts
- See ‚ÄúTimeline‚Äù page with posts (with number of likes and comments) written by me and all my friends (the most recent posts on the top)
- Timeline page should be the root page of the app
